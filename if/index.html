<h1>if</h1>
<span class="function_description">
   <i>if</i>, which is used in conjunction with a comparison operator, tests whether a certain condition has been reached, such as an input being above a certain number.
<span class="function_example">
<pre>
<code class="c">if (someVariable > 10) {
    // do something here
}
</code>
</pre>
   This program tests to see if some variable is greater than 10. If it is, the program takes a particular action. In other words, if the statement in parentheses is true, the statements inside the brackets are run. If not, the program skips over the code.
</span> 

<span class="function_description_note">
    The brackets may be omitted after an <i>if</i> statement. If this is done, the next line (ended by the <span class="function_ref">semicolon</span>) becomes the only conditional statement.
    </span>
</span>
<span class="function_example">
<pre>
<code class="c">// all are correct

if (x > 120) digitalWrite(LEDpin, HIGH); 

if (x > 120)
    digitalWrite(15, HIGH); 

if (x > 120) { digitalWrite(15, HIGH); } 

if (x > 120){ 
    digitalWrite(15, HIGH);
    digitalWrite(16, HIGH); 
}</code>

</span>
<span class="function_description_note"><i>if</i> can also be part of a branching control structure using the <span class="function_ref"link="if-else">if...else</span> construction</span>
