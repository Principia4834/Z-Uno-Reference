<h1>ZUNO_SETUP_ASSOCIATIONS()</h1>
<span class="function_description">
This macro defines association groups in Z-Uno. Association groups are used to control other devices in Z-Wave network.
<br/>
<br/>
In terms of Z-Wave protocol this macro instructs Sketch bootloader to create additional Association groups in the Z-Uno board exposed using Association Command Class.
<br/>
<br/>
Each group should have it's own dedicated function.

<span class="function_description_more">
There is only three possible types available:
<ul>
    <li>ZUNO_ASSOCIATION_GROUP_SET_VALUE &mdash; send switch on/off commands (using Basic Command Class) to devices in Z-Wave network by calling <span class="function_ref">zunoSendToGroupSetValueCommand</span>()</li>
    <li>ZUNO_ASSOCIATION_GROUP_SET_VALUE_AND_DIM &mdash; send dimming commands (using Switch Multilevel Command Class) to devices in Z-Wave network by calling <span class="function_ref">zunoSendToGroupDimmingCommand</span>(). You can also use <span class="function_ref">zunoSendToGroupSetValueCommand</span>() for devices in this group to send switch on/off commands (using Basic Command Class).</li>
    <li>ZUNO_ASSOCIATION_GROUP_SCENE_CONTROL &mdash; send scene activation commands (using Scene Activation Command Class) to devices in Z-Wave network by calling <span class="function_ref">zunoSendToGroupScene</span>()</li>
    
    <li>ZUNO_ASSOCIATION_GROUP_DOORLOCK &mdash; send door lock open/close commands (using Door Lock Command Class) to devices in Z-Wave network by calling <span class="function_ref">zunoSendToGroupDoorlockControl</span>()</li>
</ul>

Groups are numbered in the same order as they are mentioned in parameters to ZUNO_SETUP_ASSOCIATIONS() macro.
</span>

<span class="function_description_note">Association groups should be referred by these macros:
    <ul>
        <li>CTRL_GROUP_1</li>
        <li>CTRL_GROUP_2</li>
        <li>CTRL_GROUP_3</li>
        <li>CTRL_GROUP_4</li>
        <li>CTRL_GROUP_5</li>
    </ul>
</span>

<span class="function_description_note">
Real association groups number are shifted by one. Means CTRL_GROUP_1 is in reality number 2. This is because number 1 is Life Line group. Read more in description of <span class="function_ref">Z-Wave</span> implementation.
</span>

<span class="function_description_note">
After changing number and types of association groups Z-Uno must be excluded and included back. Z-Uno will not adopt any changes of association groups without being excluded. (A <a href="../z-wave/configuration-parameters/index.html">debug configuration parameter</a> can disable this restriction).
