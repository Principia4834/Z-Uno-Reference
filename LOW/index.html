<h1>LOW</h1>
<span class="function_description"> 
The meaning of LOW also has a different meaning depending on whether a pin is set to <span class="function_ref">INPUT</span> or <span class="function_ref">OUTPUT</span>. When a pin is configured as an INPUT with <span class="function_ref">pinMode</span>(), and read with <span class="function_ref">digitalRead</span>(), the Z-Uno will report LOW if a voltage less than 2 volts is present at the pin (3.3V boards).
</span>

<span class="function_description_more">When a pin is configured to OUTPUT with pinMode(), and set to LOW with <span class="function_ref">digitalWrite</span>(), the pin is at 0 volts. In this state it can sink current, e.g. light an LED that is connected through a series resistor to +3.3 volts.
