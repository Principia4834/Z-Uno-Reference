<h1>Pins configured as OUTPUT</h1>
<span class="function_description">
Pins configured as OUTPUT with <span class="function_ref">pinMode</span>() are said to be in a low-impedance state. This means that they can provide a substantial amount of current to other circuits. This makes them useful for powering LEDs because LEDs typically use less than 16 mA (see <a href="../../technical.html">electrical characteristics</a> for more info on pins max current). Loads greater than 16 mA (e.g. motors) will require a transistor or other interface circuitry.

<span class="function_description_note">
Pins configured as outputs can be damaged or destroyed if they are connected to either the ground or positive power rails.
