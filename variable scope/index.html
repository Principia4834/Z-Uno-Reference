    <h1>variable scope</h1>

<span class="function_description">Variables in the C programming language, which Z-Uno uses, have a property called scope. This is in contrast to early versions of languages such as BASIC where every variable is a global variable.</span>

<span class="function_description_more">A global variable is one that can be seen by every function in a program. Local variables are only visible to the function in which they are declared. In the Z-Uno environment, any variable declared outside of a function (e.g. setup(), loop(), etc. ), is a global variable.</span>

<span class="function_description_more">When programs start to get larger and more complex, local variables are a useful way to insure that only one function has access to its own variables. This prevents programming errors when one function inadvertently modifies variables used by another function.</span>

<span class="function_description_more">It is also sometimes handy to declare and initialize a variable inside a for loop. This creates a variable that can only be accessed from inside the for-loop brackets.</span> 

<span class="function_example">
<pre>
<code class="c">int gPWMval;  // any function will see this variable

void setup() {
  // ...
}

void loop() {
    int i;    // "i" is only "visible" inside of "loop"
    // ...

    for (int j = 0; j < 100; j++) {
        // variable j can only be accessed inside the for-loop brackets
    }
}
</code></pre>
