<h1>1 millisecond Timer</h1>
<span class="function_description">
1 millisecond Timer is similiar to <span class="function_ref">GPT</span> but ticks only every 1 millisecond. It does not have any restriction or conflicts with PWM pins. It allows to measure relatively big delays to control time critical processes as well as contolling servo motors.

<span class="function_description_more">
To set up a user handler function use ZUNO_SETUP_ISR_1MSTIMER macro to as describted <span class="function_ref" link="Interrupts">here</span>.

<span class="function_example">
<pre>
<code class="c">ZUNO_SETUP_ISR_1MSTIMER(m1ms_handler);

unsigned long count_1ms = 0;

void m1ms_handler() {
    count_1ms++;
}

void setup() {
    Serial.begin(115200);
}

void loop() {
    Serial.println(count_1ms);
    delay(1000);
}
