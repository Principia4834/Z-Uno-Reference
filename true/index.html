<div id="page" role="main" itemprop="description">
    <h1>true and false</h1>
<span class="function_description">There are two constants used to represent truth and falsity: true and false.</span>

<span class="function_syntax">
<i>false</i> is defined as 0 (zero).
<br/>
<i>true</i> is often said to be defined as 1, which is correct, but true has a wider definition: any integer which is non-zero is true, in a Boolean sense. So -1, 2 and -200 are all defined as true, too, in a Boolean sense.</span>

<span class="function_description_note">Note that the true and false constants are typed in lowercase unlike HIGH, LOW, INPUT, and OUTPUT.</span>
