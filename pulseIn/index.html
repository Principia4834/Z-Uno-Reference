<h1>pulseIn()</h1>

<span class="function_description">
Reads a pulse (either HIGH or LOW) on a pin. For example, if value is HIGH, pulseIn() waits for the pin to go HIGH, starts timing, then waits for the pin to go LOW and stops timing. Returns the length of the pulse in microseconds or 0 if no complete pulse was received within the timeout.
</span>

<span class="function_description_more">
The timing of this function has been determined empirically and will probably show errors on shorter pulses. Works on pulses from 10 microseconds to 3 minutes in length. Please also note that if the pin is already high when the function is called, it will wait for the pin to go LOW and then HIGH before it starts counting.
</span>

<span class="function_description_note">
pulseIn() works only with fast pins defined via <span class="function_ref">s_pin</span> data type and hence can work only on pins 9&ndash;16.
