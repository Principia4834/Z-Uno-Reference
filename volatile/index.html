<h1>volatile</h1>

<span class="function_description">volatile is a keyword known as a variable qualifier, it is usually used before the datatype of a variable, to modify the way in which the compiler and subsequent program treats the variable.</span>

<span class="function_description_more">Declaring a variable volatile is a directive to the compiler. The compiler is software which translates your C/C++ code into the machine code.</span>

<span class="function_description_more">Specifically, it directs the compiler to load the variable from RAM and not from a storage register, which is a temporary memory location where program variables are stored and manipulated. Under certain conditions, the value for a variable stored in registers can be inaccurate.</span>

<span class="function_description_more">A variable should be declared volatile whenever its value can be changed by something beyond the control of the code section in which it appears, such as a concurrently executing thread. In the Z-Uno, the only place that this is likely to occur is in sections of code associated with interrupts, called an interrupt service routine.</span>

<span class="function_example">
<pre>
<code class="c">// toggles LED when interrupt pin changes state

int pin = 13;
volatile int state = LOW;

void setup() {
  pinMode(pin, OUTPUT);
  attachInterrupt(0, blink, CHANGE);
}

void loop() {
  digitalWrite(pin, state);
}

void blink()
{
  state = !state;
}
