<h1>Simple Sensor</h1>
<span class="example_description">
    That is a Simple Sensor Binary example. It watches over the built in button state and sends report to the controller if button's state changes. In this example we set up 1 sensor binary channel.
</span>
<span>
    Channel has one function:
<ul>
<li>getter &mdash; function, which returns the previously saved button state. This function runs only once the controller asks.</li>
</ul>
You can read more about this channel and his functions <a href="http://z-uno.z-wave.me/Reference/ZUNO_SENSOR_BINARY/">here.</a>

<span class="example_hardware_required">
<ul>
<li>Z-Uno board</li>
<li>Breadboard</li>
</ul>

// the setup routine runs once when you press reset:

<ol>
    <li><a href="/getting-started/include-in-network"><b>Include</b></a> Z-Uno into a network (if you do it the first time) or Exclude again (also by pressing the button three times), and then again Include (it will be useful if you already included the device, or just to check if it's not included in the network).</li>
    <li>Go to the <b>Elements</b> and here is your device &mdash; in this case (in sketch),  you connected a <b>Sensor Binary</b> channel, so you see the <b>Sensor General Purpose</b> and its current status (on, off), which you can control by pressing tne button (if BTN is pressed - turn the LED on, if it's released - turn the LED off).
