<h1>Pins configured as INPUT_PULLUP</h1>
<span class="function_description">
<p>Pins configured as INPUT_PULLUP with <span class="function_ref">pinMode</span>() are turned in the same state as for <span class="function_ref">INPUT</span> mode, but internal 20 kÎ© pull-up resistor is enabled. This prevents floating when nothing is connected to the pin: in such state pin will be in <span class="function_ref">HIGH</span> state. This is same as using external pull-up resistor and INPUT mode.
</span>

<span class="function_description_note">Pins configured as inputs with either INPUT or INPUT_PULLUP can be damaged or destroyed if they are connected to voltages below ground (negative voltages) or above the positive power rail (3.3V).</span>
