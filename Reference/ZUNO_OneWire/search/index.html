<h1>search()</h1>
<span class="function_description">
	Search for the next device. The newAddr is an 8 byte array. If a device is found, newAddr is filled with the device's address and true is returned. If no more devices are found, false is returned.
</span>

<span class="function_description_more">
Returns 1 if a new address has been returned. A zero might mean that the bus is shorted, there are no devices, or you have already retrieved all of them. 
It might be a good idea to check the CRC to make sure you didn't get garbage.  The order is deterministic. You will always get the same devices in the same order.
