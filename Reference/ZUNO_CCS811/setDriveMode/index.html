<h1>setDriveMode()</h1>
<span class="function_description">
	Set sample rate of the sensor. In <a href="/Reference/ZUNO_CCS811/begin/">begin</a> set default CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_1SEC.
</span>

<span class="function_description_more">
	In Modes CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_1SEC, CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_10SEC, CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_60SEC, the equivalent CO2 concentration (ppm) and TVOC concentration (ppb) are calculated for every sample.
	<ul>
		<li>Mode CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_1SEC reacts fastest to gas presence, but has a higher operating current</li>
		<li>Mode CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_60SEC reacts more slowly to gas presence but has the lowest average operating current.</li>
	</ul>
</span>

<span class="function_description_more">
	When a sensor operating mode is changed to a new mode with a lower sample rate (e.g. from Mode CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_1SEC to Mode CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_60SEC), it should be placed in Mode 0 (Idle) for at least 10 minutes before enabling the new mode. 
	When a sensor operating mode is changed to a new mode with a higher sample rate (e.g. from Mode CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_60SEC to Mode CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_1SEC), there is no requirement to wait before enabling the new mode.
</span>

<span class="function_description_more">
	Mode CCS811_DRIVE_MODE_250MS is intended for systems where an external host system wants to run an algorithm with raw data and this mode provides new sample data every 250ms
</span>

<span class="function_description_note" zunoVersion="v2">
	Mode timings are subject to typical 2% tolerance due to accuracy of internal clock
