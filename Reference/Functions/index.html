<h1>Functions</h1>
<p>Segmenting code into functions allows a programmer to create modular pieces of code that perform a defined task and then return to the area of code from which the function was "called". The typical case for creating a function is when one needs to perform the same action multiple times in a program.</p>

<p>For programmers accustomed to using BASIC, functions in Arduino provide (and extend) the utility of using subroutines (GOSUB in BASIC).</p>

<p>Standardizing code fragments into functions has several advantages:</p>
<ul type="circle">
<li>Functions help the programmer stay organized. Often this helps to conceptualize the program.</li>
<li>Functions codify one action in one place so that the function only has to be thought out and debugged once.</li>
<li>This also reduces chances for errors in modification, if the code needs to be changed.</li>
<li>Functions make the whole sketch smaller and more compact because sections of code are reused many times.</li>
<li>They make it easier to reuse code in other programs by making it more modular, and as a nice side effect, using functions also often makes the code more readable.</li>
</ul>
<p>
There are two required functions in an Arduino sketch, setup() and loop(). Other functions must be created outside the brackets of those two functions. As an example, we will create a simple function to multiply two numbers.

<span class="function_example">
<p>To "call" our simple multiply function, we pass it parameters of the datatype that it is expecting:</p>
<pre>
<code class="c">
void loop() {
  int i = 2;
  int j = 3;
  int k;

  k = myMultiplyFunction(i, j); // k now contains 6
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
Our function needs to be declared outside any other function, so "myMultiplyFunction()" can go either above or below the "loop()" function. The entire sketch would then look like this:
</p>
</span>

<pre>
<code class="c">
void setup() {
  Serial.begin();
}

void loop() {
  int i = 2;
  int j = 3;
  int k;

  k = myMultiplyFunction(i, j); // k now contains 6
  Serial.println(k);
  delay(500);
}

int myMultiplyFunction(int x, int y) {
  int result;
  result = x * y;
  return result;
}
</code>
</pre>
</span>

<span class="function_example">
<p>
This function will read a sensor five times with analogRead() and calculate the average of five readings. It then scales the data to 8 bits (0-255), and inverts it, returning the inverted result.
</p>
<pre>
<code class="c">
int ReadSens_and_Condition(){
  int i;
  int sval = 0;

  for (i = 0; i < 5; i++){
    sval = sval + analogRead(0);    // sensor on analog pin 0
  }

  sval = sval / 5;    // average
  sval = sval / 4;    // scale to 8 bits (0 - 255)
  sval = 255 - sval;  // invert output
  return sval;
}
</code>
</pre>

<p>
To call our function we just assign it to a variable:
</p>
</span>

<pre>
<code class="c">
int sens;

sens = ReadSens_and_Condition();
</code>
</pre>
</span>
