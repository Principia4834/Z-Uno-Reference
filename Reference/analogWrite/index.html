<h1>analogWrite()</h1> 
<span class="function_description" zunoVersion="v1">
Writes an analog value (PWM wave) to a pin. Can be used to light a LED varying brightnesses or drive a motor at various speeds.
After a call to analogWrite(), the pin will generate a steady square wave of the specified duty cycle until the next call to analogWrite() (or a call to <span class="function_ref">digitalRead</span>() or <span class="function_ref">digitalWrite</span>() on the same pin)

PWM 1-4 works at 488 Hz. If you need faster operation, use <span class="function_ref">zunoFastPWM</span>() on A0.

By default Z-Uno2 works at 488 Hz for backward compatibilty. You can tweak carrier frequency youself in wide range using <span class="function_ref">analogWriteFrequency</span>.
