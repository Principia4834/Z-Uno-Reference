<h1>ZUNO_SETUP_SLEEPING_MODE()</h1>
<span class="function_description">
This macro defines how Z-Uno will manage power mode. It is very important to define correct mode because the behavior of the device changes dramatically depending on it. At the start, we recommend you to debug and develop your program using ZUNO_SLEEPING_MODE_ALWAYS_AWAKE mode, because thatâ€™s the easiest one.
<br/>
<br/>
If not specified in the project, ZUNO_SETUP_SLEEPING_MODE(ZUNO_SLEEPING_MODE_ALWAYS_AWAKE) is assumed.

There is only three possible values available:
<ul>
    <li>ZUNO_SLEEPING_MODE_ALWAYS_AWAKE &mdash; device is <b>always awake</b>, reachable and helps to form mesh network acting as router (default mode). Used for mains powered devices.</li>
    <li zunoVersion="v1">ZUNO_SLEEPING_MODE_SLEEPING &mdash; device <b>wakes up by user request (interrupt) or periodically</b>. Does not help to form mesh. Used for battery powered devices.</li>
    <li zunoVersion="v2">ZUNO_SLEEPING_MODE_SLEEPING &mdash; device <b>wakes up by user request (interrupt) or periodically</b>. Does not help to form mesh. Used for battery powered devices. For Z-Uno V2 there are 2 variants of deep sleep mode: <b>EM2</b> and <b>EM4</b>. EM2 provides most peripherals avaliable during it, fast wakeup, RAM retention, but it's not so effective as EM4. EM4 is most effective energy saving mode. It provides minimal consumption current about 5-7 microamps. Commonly sleeping devices are sensors or remote controls in Z-Wave network.</li>
    <li>ZUNO_SLEEPING_MODE_FREQUENTLY_AWAKE &mdash; device <b>wakes up by user request (interrupt) or on packet received</b>. Always available but does not help to form mesh. Used for battery powered devices. In Z-Wave this type of devices is called <b>FLiRS</b> FLiRS is less power effective compared to previous "sleeping" type. This type commonly is used for battery powred actuators (not sensors) devices like sirens, doorlocks, valves and etc. </li>
</ul>
    <span class="function_description_more"><b>FLiRS</b> &mdash; Frequently Listening Routing Slaves &mdash; the device periodically quits the sleeping mode on a short period and checks, whether a message is sent to the device. If no packets are present for this device on air, the device goes back into the sleeping mode. Awakening interval is 1 second.
    </span>
</span>

<span class="function_tip">
In <b>sleeping</b> mode periodical wakeup is configured via the Z-Wave controller using the Wake Up Command Class. <span zunoVersion="v1">The period is a factor of 4 minutes, minumum is 4 minutes.</span> Interrupt can wake up the device at any time.
    <span  zunoVersion="v2">
    User can configurate custom wakeup interval using <span class="function_ref">zunoSetCustomWUPTimer</span>() function for <b>FLiRS</b> and <b>sleeping</b> modes.
    You are able to wake up device from sleeping EM2 or FLIRS mode device using any pin, you need just bind this pin to interrupt controller using <span class="function_ref" link="Interrupts/attachInterrupt">attachInterrupt</span>() function.
    If you need to wakeup device from sleeping EM4 mode you are able to do it only by means of these pins: <b>#2, #4(A1), #11, #16(PW4), #18, #23(BTN)</b>. You can add needed pin to "wakeup" list by means of <span class="function_ref" link="zunoEM4EnablePinWakeup">zunoEM4EnablePinWakeup</span>() function. By default pins <b>#18</b> and <b>BTN</b> are already binded to wakeup device from EM2/EM4 modes.
    </span>
</span>

<span class="function_description_note" zunoVersion="v1">
Note that in sleeping and FLiRS mode devices should be explicitely sent into sleeping state. This is done using <b><span class="function_ref">zunoSendDeviceToSleep</span>()</b> function. Once called, loop will not be called anymore and Z-Uno will finalize all jobs to go into sleep mode.
</span>

<span class="function_description_note" zunoVersion="v1">
Note that in sleeping and FLiRS mode during power consumption (deep sleep) state Z-Uno memory is not maintained. Hence it is cleaned all the time. If you want to keep some variables across sleeps you have to use <b><span class="function_ref">NZRAM</span></b> memory (very fast and do not consume enery) or <b><span class="function_ref">EEPROM</span></b> (slow and takes energy to read and write, but survive even during power off - this is a so called non-volatile memory).
</span>

<span class="function_description_note" zunoVersion="v2">
 Note that if you selected sleeping EM4 mode and the device wasn't included to network it doesn't go deeper then EM2 mode because of <b>SmartStart</b> technology. So it doesn't call <b>setup()</b> function on each wakeup as it described below. </span>. 
</span>

<span class="function_description_note" zunoVersion="v2">
Note that in sleeping <b>EM2</b> and FLiRS modes during power consumption (deep sleep) state Z-Uno memory is not cleaned. So your logic feels like it doesn't stop and you don't need to save & restore you variables in <b>EEPROM</b>. The <b>setup()</b> function doesn't call when devices wakes up, because you don't need to reinitialize hardware. If you need to call your code when device wakes up please use system handler <span class="function_ref" link="zunoAttachSysHandler">ZUNO_HANDLER_WUP</span>.

<span class="function_tip" zunoVersion="v1">
If device is in sleeping mode, the USB port is not available for uploading new sketch. Device should be woken up or turned into <a href="/getting-started/troubleshooting">rescue mode</a> before uploading new sketch.
</span>

<span class="function_tip" zunoVersion="v2">
If device is in sleeping mode, the USB port is available if you connect to it, because Z-Uno 2 has separate USB controller. Device will be booted into bootloader mode when you try to open its serial port. You don't need to make any special things to flash sketch inside sleeping or FLIRS device.
</span>

<span class="function_description_note">
After changing sleeping mode Z-Uno must be excluded and included back. Z-Uno will not adopt sleeping mode change without being excluded. <span zunoVersion="v1">(A <a href="/z-wave/configuration-parameters/">debug configuration parameter</a> can disable this restriction)</span>.
