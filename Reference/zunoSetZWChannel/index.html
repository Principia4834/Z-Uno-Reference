<h1>zunoSetZWChannel()</h1>
<span class="function_description">
Binds device channel to Z-Wave multichannel instance.
</span>

<span class="function_description_more">
First you have to add desired channel using <span class="function_ref">zunoAddChannel</span>, and then you are able to set its multichannel instance via <b>zunoSetZWChannel</b>.
You can bind device channel directly to the main end point, to any multichannel end point, or both to main end point and to some of availiable multichannel end points. You can't bind two channels of the same type to the main endpoint. Each multichannel endpoint represents only one channel of device. It's hightly recommended to bind only the general functionality of the device to main endpoint. For example if you have relay device with energy metering map SwitchBinary to main endpoint, SensorMultilevel channel bind to the first multichannel endpoint.
