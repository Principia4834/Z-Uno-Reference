<h1>Z-Wave in Z-Uno</h1>
<p>Z-Wave is a wireless home automation protocol. Designed for DIY and IoT it is very simple to deploy in your home.</p>

<p>Working on sub-gigahertz frequencies it does not have interference with other wireless systems like WiFi, Bluetooth, LTE and others. In different regions Z-Wave frequencies differs and <a href="https://www.silabs.com/products/wireless/mesh-networking/z-wave/benefits/technology/global-regions">varies from 860 to 930 MHz</a>. Z-Uno supports all Z-Wave frequencies. You can choose the required frequency in Arduino IDE.</p><p>
Z-Uno delivers out of the box Z-Wave funtionality. Your sketch will interact with other Z-Wave products in your network via radio protocol according to <b>Z-Wave Plus</b> standards. You don't need to know deep Z-Wave protocol â€” Z-Uno will hide all Z-Wave internals and provide you simple to use functions.</p>

<h2 link="Channels">Channels</h2>
<p>To allow multiple functions in one device Z-Wave introduces <b>channels</b> (sometimes called instances). Z-Uno follows this concept allowing you to create very complex  devices. Each channel in Z-Uno will have it's own functionality. Each channel hosts only two Command Classes: Basic and one of Switch Binary/Switch Multilevel/Sensor Binary/Sensor Multilevel depending on the channel type. Use <span class="function_ref">ZUNO_SETUP_CHANNELS</span> macro to setup types of channels.</p>
<p>You can also partially control Z-Uno without using channels: first channel of each type is <b>mapped</b> to the corresponding Command Class outside channels.</p>
<p>Example: Z-Uno with channels #1 Switch Multilevel, #2 Switch Binary, #3 Switch Multilevel, #4 Sensor Binary, #5 Sensor Binary will allow to control without channels Switch Multilevel (from channel #1), Switch Binary (from channel #3) and Sennsor Binary (from channel #4).</p>
<p>If no channels are specified, Z-Uno will present Sensor Binary (and Basic mapped to it) to report Service Button state.</p>
<p>If there is only one channel of each type, Z-Uno will not create any channels and will keep only Command Classes outside channels.</p>
<p>All SensorMultilevel of different types are aggregated in one channel. If more than one SensorMultilevel of the same type is defined, a new channel will be created. This will make mostly non-channeled devices in many cases and simplify Z-Uno representation in most controllers. If both Switch Binary and Switch Multilevel are only present outside of channels some controllers (like Fibaro Home Center) will show only Switch Multilevel. To solve this use macro <span class="function_ref" link="ZUNO_ENABLE">ZUNO_DISABLE</span>(NO_MULTIBINARY_SWITCH0)</p>

<h2 link="Basic interoperability">Basic interoperability</h2>
<p>Z-Wave provides Basic interoperability between different devices from different manufacturers via Basic Command Class. This Command Class is <b>mapped</b> to the corresponding Switch Binary/Switch Multilevel/Sensor Binary/Sensor Multilevel depending on channel type. Basic outside of channel behaves like Basic on channel #1.</p>

<h2 link="Associations">Associations</h2>
<p>Z-Uno allows to report values from each channel (be it a sensors or switch channel) out of the box. This is know as Life Line.</p>

<p>But it is also important to be able to control other devices in Z-Wave network. For this Z-Wave protocol introduces <b>association groups</b> or shortly associations. Association group is just a list of other devices in the network to whom Z-Uno is supposed to send some commands. This list is managed using standard UI provided by all existing Z-Wave controllers. Each association group is defined to have one of the allowed types depending on commands we want to be sent out. This can be control of switches or control of dimmers or even scenes switching. You can manage association groups using <span class="function_ref">ZUNO_SETUP_ASSOCIATIONS</span> macro.</p>

<p>Z-Uno Associations supports simple and channel (managed by Association and MultiChannel Association Command Classes correspondingly). Each group (control groups and Life Line) can host up to 5 entries.</p>

<h2 link="Power management">Power management</h2>
<p>Z-Wave was design to allow very low power  consumption profile. Hence, many sensors are battery powered and can work more than two years without battery replacement. But as a side effect, such devices have to sleep most of the time to save battery and wake up only for short period to send reports to controller upon environment changes (i.e. temperature has changed or button is pressed). In Z-Wave these devices are called <b>sleeping</b>. Usually all battery powered sensors are sleeping. Wakeup period can be configured via <b>Wakeup</b> Command Class from Z-Wave controller.
</p>
<p>To solve this reachability problems of battery devices Z-Wave allows another type of power management mode called <b>frequently listening</b> or FLiRS. These devices wake up every second to check if there is something for them in the ether and goes immediately back into sleep. In this mode initial communication to such device will take a bit more than one second and during this second the ether will be jammed. But after this the device will react very fast. The battery in this mode will last for only about one year. Usual applications of frequently listening is a battery operated switch, alarm or door lock.
</p><p>
All mains powered devices such as dimmers, switches and other actors are <b>always listening</b>. This means they are always reachable instantly, they always listen for ether and can act as <b>repeaters</b> for other devices forming mesh network.
</p><p>
Z-Uno supports all three types of power management modes. You can define it using <span class="function_ref">ZUNO_SETUP_SLEEPING_MODE</span> macro in your sketch.</p>

<h2 link="Configuration parameters">Configuration parameters</h2>
<p>Beside defining Z-Uno behavior in the user sketch, there are also few configuration parameters. Some parameters can be defined only during sketch upload (via Arduino IDE menu), others can be changed wirelessly via Z-Wave Configuration. Get more details on <a href="/z-wave/configuration-parameters/">supported parameters</a>.</p>

<h2 link="Include/exclude, wake up and sending NIF">Include/exclude, wake up and sending NIF</h2>
<p>To become part of Z-Wave network Z-Uno need to be included (added) to the network using Z-Wave controller. Read more about <a href="/getting-started/include-in-network">inclusion and exclusion processes</a>. Inclusion and exclusion are confirmed on Z-Uno by <b>three press on the Service button</b>. This sequence will also tell Z-Uno to send <b>Node Information Frame</b> (NIF).</p>
<p zunoVersion="v2">You are able to use special non-secure inclusion using this sequence: hold the Service button until you'll see that the red LED is blinking, release the Service button and then short press it.</p>
<p>Once sleeping power mode is used, Z-Uno will remain in deep sleep most of the time. <b>Single press on Service button</b> will wake up Z-Uno.</p>


<h2 link="Security">Security</h2>
<p>Z-Wave protocol allows secure commands transmission to bring more privacy to your IoT network. To enable Security in Z-Uno use Arduino IDE menu item. Once Security is turned on Z-Uno will follow the rules below:</p>
<ul>
    <li zunoVersion="v1">All control commands to Z-Uno must be secure.</li>
    <li zunoVersion="v2">All control commands to Z-Uno must be secure and use the highest avaliable for Z-Uno node S2-key.</li>
    <li>All commands sent by Z-Uno (based on Association groups) follow rules:
        <ul zunoVersion="v1" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0;">
            <li>First time Z-Uno tries to speak securelly.</li>
            <li>If success, Z-Uno will memorize that this device must always be spoken securelly.</li>
            <li>If fails, Z-Uno will remember this and send unsecure commands to such a device.</li>
        </ul>
        <ul zunoVersion="v2" style="margin-bottom: 0; margin-top: 0;">
            <li>LifeLine group always uses the highest avaliable level. You have to add to lifeline group only the nodes with highest securiry level (the highest S2 key of this Z-Uno).</li>
            <li>All other "control" groups uses dynamic detection strategy. 
                <ul> <li>Z-Uno setups the highest avaliable S2-key</li>
                     <li>(2) Z-Uno sends special command to node using current key and Z-Uno waits for report.</li>
                     <li>If node answers, Z-Uno will memorize that detected S2-level and uses it for futher communication with this node.</li>
                     <li>If node doesn't answer Z-Uno reduces the security level and goes to (2).</li>
                     <li>If node doesn't answer on any level (included unsecure) Z-Uno marks node as failed.</li>
                </ul>
        </ul>
        <li>This approach allows to mix secure and unsecure devices in the same Association group.</li>
    <li zunoVersion="v1">Only descriptive Command Classes are accessible without of Security: Battery, Device Reset Locally, Firmware Update, Manufacturer Specific, Power Level, Version, Wakeup, Z-Wave Plus Info.</li>
    <li zunoVersion="v2">Only these Command Classes are accessible without of Security when device was included securely: Z-Wave Plus Info, Transport Service, Security, Security2, Supervision</li>
</ul>

<p zunoVersion="v2">You are able to reset Z-Uno using this sequence: hold the Service button until you'll see that the red LED is blinking, release the Service button and then triple click on it. You have to see another red LED pattern when device will be ready.</p>


<h2 zunoVersion="v2" link="Node Identification">Node Identification</h2>
<p zunoVersion="v2">Z-Uno supports <b>Indicator</b> command class that is used to identify specific node in network. For its identification Z-Uno uses red LED. </p>

<h2 link="Changing Z-Wave settings">Changing Z-Wave settings</h2>
<p>Z-Uno sketch defines number of channels, their types, number of association groups and power mode. Arduino IDE also allows to turn on/off security. But Z-Wave do not allow to change these paramenters &laquo;on the fly&raquo;. To remain compatible with Z-Wave Plus, Z-Uno <b>will not adopt these changes until device is excluded or resetted</b>.</p>
