<h1>const</h1>

<span class="function_description">The const keyword stands for constant. It is a variable qualifier that modifies the behavior of the variable, making a variable "read-only". This means that the variable can be used just as any other variable of its type, but its value cannot be changed. You will get a compiler error if you try to assign a value to a const variable.

<span class="function_description_more">Constants defined with the const keyword obey the rules of variable scoping that govern other variables. This, and the pitfalls of using #define, makes the const keyword a superior method for defining constants and is preferred over using <span class="function_ref" link="define">#define</span></span>

<span class="function_example">
<pre>
<code class="c">const float pi = 3.14;
float x;

x = pi * 2;    // it's fine to use const's in math

pi = 7;        // illegal - you can't write to (modify) a constant</code></pre>
