    <h1>bitwise xor</h1>
<span class="function_description">There is a somewhat unusual operator in C++ called bitwise exclusive OR, also known as bitwise XOR. (In English this is usually pronounced "eks-or".) The bitwise XOR operator is written using the caret symbol ^. This operator is similar to the bitwise OR operator |, except that it evaluates to 1 for a given position when exactly one of the input bits for that position is 1. If both are 0 or both are 1, the XOR operator evaluates to 0:</span>
<span class="function_example">
<pre>
<code class="c">0 ^ 0 == 0
0 ^ 1 == 1
1 ^ 0 == 1
1 ^ 1 == 0
</code>
</pre>
</span>

<span class="function_description_more">Another way to look at bitwise XOR is that each bit in the result is a 1 if the input bits are different, or 0 if they are the same.</span>

<span class="function_description_more">Here is a simple code example:</span>

<span class="function_example">
<pre>
<code class="c">int x = 12;     // binary: 1100
int y = 10;     // binary: 1010
int z = x ^ y;  // binary: 0110, or decimal 6
</code>
</pre>
</span> 

<span class="function_description_more">The ^ operator is often used to toggle (i.e. change from 0 to 1, or 1 to 0) some of the bits in an integer expression while leaving others alone. For example:</span>
<span class="function_example">

<pre>
<code class="c">y = x ^ 1;   // toggle the lowest bit in x, and store the result in y.
</code>
</pre>
</span>
