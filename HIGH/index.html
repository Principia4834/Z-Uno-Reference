<h1>HIGH</h1>
<span class="function_description">The meaning of HIGH (in reference to a pin) is somewhat different depending on whether a pin is set to an <span class="function_ref">INPUT</span> or <span class="function_ref">OUTPUT</span>. When a pin is configured as an INPUT with <span class="function_ref">pinMode</span>(), and read with <span class="function_ref">digitalRead</span>(), the Z-Uno will report HIGH if a voltage greater than 2 volts is present at the pin.</span>

<span class="function_description_more">A pin may also be configured as an INPUT with pinMode(), and subsequently made HIGH with <span class="function_ref">digitalWrite</span>(). This will enable the internal 20K pullup resistors, which will pull up the input pin to a HIGH reading unless it is pulled <span class="function_ref">LOW</span> by external circuitry. This is how <span class="function_ref">INPUT_PULLUP</span> works and is described below in more detail.</span>
</span>

<span class="function_description_more">When a pin is configured to OUTPUT with pinMode(), and set to HIGH with digitalWrite(), the pin is at 3.3 volts. In this state it can source current, e.g. light an LED that is connected through a series resistor to ground.</span>
